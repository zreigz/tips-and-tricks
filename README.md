# How do I find all files containing specific text on linux

```
grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
```

Along with these, `--exclude`, `--include`, `--exclude-dir` or `--include-dir` flags could be used for efficient searching:

 - This will only search through those files which have .c or .h extensions:

```
grep --include=\*.{c,h} -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
```

 - This will exclude searching all the files ending with .o extension:

```
grep --exclude=*.o -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e "pattern"
```

# Test if a port on a remote system is reachable 

```
nc 127.0.0.1 123 &> /dev/null; echo $?
```

Will output 0 if port 123 is open, and 1 if it's closed.

# Get available IP addresses in network

```
$ nmap -v -sn -n 10.172.196.66/26 -oG - | awk '/Status: Down/{print $2}'
```
